# Text-Generation
This is a text generation program that takes in a text document as input, analyzes word frequency and text structure and outputs a new text document that mirrors the original. Example use cases would be to input a person's speech and the output would be a computer generated text file that should be another speech similar to the way the input file was written/spoken
